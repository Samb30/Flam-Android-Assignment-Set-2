## âœ… Q1: N-Queens Puzzle â€“ Backtracking Approach
`/Q1_Nqueens/Q1.java`

### ðŸ§  Approach:

This solution written in java language uses a **backtracking algorithm** based approach. In the algorithm all the queens are placed one column at a time. This ensures that at each step no two queens threaten each other. For every valid queen placement, it moves to the next column recursively. If it successfully places a queen in each column (i.e., reaches the end of the board), it constructs the current board configuration into a list of strings and adds it to the final result. If a conflict is detected, the algorithm backtracks by removing the previously placed queen and trying the next possible position. This systematic trial-and-error approach guarantees that all distinct solutions are explored.
