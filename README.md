## Q1: N-Queens Puzzle â€“ Backtracking Approach

ðŸ“„ [Q1_Nqueens/Q1.java](./Q1_Nqueens/Q1.java)

### ðŸ§  Approach:

<p align="justify">
This solution is written in Java language which uses a backtracking algorithm-based approach. In this algorithm, all the queens are placed in one column at a time. This ensures that no two queens threaten each other at any point. Every valid queen placement is followed by a recursive move to the next column. If all the queens are successfully placed in every column, the current board configuration is converted into a list of strings and added to the final result. If a conflict is identified, the algorithm backtracks by removing the previously placed queen and tries the next possible position.

## Q2: Module Dependency â€“ Cycle Detection

ðŸ“„ [Q2_ModuleLoader/Q2.java](./Q2_ModuleLoader/Q2.java)

### ðŸ§  Approach:

<p align="justify">
This solution is written in Java language which solves the problem of detecting circular dependencies in a module loading system. The dependencies are considered as a directed graph where each module is a node and a dependency is a directed edge. The algorithm uses a DFS approach to traverse the graph and identify cycles. To identify cycles, it maintains two data structures: a visited list and a recursion stack. In the DFS traversal, if a node is encountered that is already in the current recursion stack and a cycle is detected, the function returns true. If all nodes are processed without detecting such a case, the graph is confirmed to be acyclic.
